    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      My grandmother's recipe for roasted chicken. We are German and she used to
      do it this way all the time. I never have had a chicken this juicy before;
      this little trick works and makes the people eating it go silent. It's
      funny. We nibble on the celery after.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p><em>Original recipe yields 6 servings</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, giblets removed</li>
      <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon onion powder, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 cup sliced black olives</li>
      <li>1/2 cup margarine, divided</li>
      <li>1 stalk celery, leaves removed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Place chicken in a roasting pan, and season generously inside and out
        with salt and pepper. Sprinkle inside and out with onion powder. Place 3
        tablespoons margarine in the chicken cavity. Arrange dollops of the
        remaining margarine around the chicken's exterior. Cut the celery into 3
        or 4 pieces, and place in the chicken cavity.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake chicken uncovered in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the
        bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. An
        instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh,
        near the bone, should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Remove from
        heat and baste with melted margarine and drippings. Cover with aluminum
        foil and allow to rest about 30 minutes before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
